# Overview 

The purpose of this assignment was to create a team building web application. The user could add team members through the terminal. The application would then sort the team member into 3 categories engineer, manager and intern. After all the members had been added, the application would dynamically generate a team.html document where all the team members were displayed.  

# Technologies Used 

 * Inquirer npm package  was used to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.

* The app rean Node CLI to gather information about each employee.

# Final Thoughts 

I found this assingment to be a challenge, as it really tested my knowledge about promises. I am still building my understanding of testing and using constructors. However, i feel more confident working out of the terminal and using inquirer. I look forward to building more applications similar to this.
